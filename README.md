Prediction based on Logistic regression 


The current experiment speaks about breast Cancer prediction which is a classification problem, the model use for prediction is Logistic regression for which I have used statsmodels.api for predicting the accuracy through logistic regression observed that features like radius_mean texture_mean smoothness_mean compactness_mean symmetry_mean play a major role in prediction through the visualization(Heatmap) of the correlation between these features(X) and diagnosis (Y).
